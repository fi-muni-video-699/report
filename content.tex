\section{Introduction}
Since the spring of 2004, the Faculty of Informatics at the Masaryk University
in Brno, Czech Republic (FI MU) has been recording lectures that take place in
the \abbr{D1}, \abbr{D2}, and \abbr{D3} lecture halls and making these
recordings available to students at the
\href{https://www.video.muni.cz}{video.muni.cz} web site as \term{digital video
files}~\cite{hladkaliska03lectures}. These recordings are a valuable learning
resource; however, due to the lack of information about the structure and the
content of these recordings, it is difficult to
\begin{enumerate}
\item retrieve recordings relevant to the user's \term{information need},
\item find relevant portions in the retrieved recordings, and
\item transform the information contained in the recording to a form that is more
  accessible to visually impaired users.
\end{enumerate}
As a result, the usefulness of these recordings is rarely fully exploited.

Most lecturers accompany their lectures with \term{lecture slides} that are shown
on the recordings and, at the same time, available for the students as a part of
the course materials in the form of structured \abbr{PDF} documents. One way to
add structured information to the recordings is then to find a mapping between the
temporal dimension of a recording and the pages of the corresponding lecture
slides. This gives us the digital form of the text that is being shown on any
given \term{frame} of the recordings, which can be immediately used to
\begin{enumerate}
\item retrieve portions of recordings relevant to the user's information need
  expressed in the form of a text query and
\item convey the text to the visually impaired user using a screen reader, a
  braille display, or another reading device.
\end{enumerate}
Other uses include the improvement of the perceived recording quality by
superimposing a high-resolution rendering of the \abbr{PDF} document pages on
the low-resolution digital video files.

The text is structured as follows: In section~\ref{sec:subtasks}, I will
describe the individual subtasks of a solution to the above goal, …

\section{Subtasks}
\label{sec:subtasks}
\subsection{Sources of noise}
To better understand the intricacies of our task, let us first discuss what
kinds of \term{noise} we can expect to appear in our recordings.

\paragraph{Projection} Often, a lecturer will use an unpublished version of the
lecture slides that contains additional pages with \term{incrementally uncovered}
content. In this case, the lecture slides from the course materials may be a
poor fit to what is shown on the recordings.

Occasionally, a lecturer will also show their lecture slides in a window rather
than in a full-screen mode. Therefore, finding the position of a projection
screen and finding the position of a lecture slide within a \term{projection
screen} become two distinct tasks.

\paragraph{Scene} Due to the defects in the optical system of any camera, a
lecture room recording will suffer from a number of \term{aberrations} such as
defocus and distortion. In addition, if the camera is not perpendicular to a
projection screen, an \term{inverse perspective transform} of the recording
will be necessary to make the region corresponding to a projection screen
rectangular.

Let $\mathcal X$ be the \term{color space} of the lecture slides, $\mathcal Y$
the color space of the \term{projector}, and $\Phi_{\mathcal X},\Phi_{\mathcal
Y}$ the maps to the common color space $\mathbb K$. If the overlap between
$\Phi_{\mathcal X}(\mathcal X)$ and $\Phi_{\mathcal Y}(\mathcal Y)$ is small,
$\Phi^{-1}_{\mathcal Y}(\Phi_{\mathcal X}(\mathcal X))$ will be a poor
representation of $\mathcal X$. Even if $\Phi_{\mathcal X}(\mathcal
X)\approx\Phi_{\mathcal Y}(\mathcal Y)$, the \term{reflectance} of the
projection screen surface will distort the colors.

Due to the lightning conditions, the projection screen will in general be
\term{unevenly-lit}.

Obstacles positioned between the \term{camera lens} and a projection screen may
partially obscure the recorded lecture slides.

\paragraph{Capture} The guesswork in assessing the \term{color temperature},
the presence of light sources that produce different color spectra compared to
\term{blackbodies}, and the potentially small overlap between $\Phi_{\mathcal
Y}(\mathcal Y)$ and $\Phi_{\mathcal Z}(\mathcal Z)$, where $\mathcal Z$ is the
color space of the projector will further distort the colors.

Unlike lecture slides, which are generally provided in the form of vector
\abbr{PDF} documents, the resulting digital video files are a result of
\begin{enumerate}
  \item temporal sampling into frames at a given \term{framerate},
  \item spatial sampling at a given \term{resolution},
  \item frequency sampling at a given \term{color depth},
  \item \term{chroma subsampling}, and 5. \term{lossy compression}
\end{enumerate}
applied to the original recording. Each of the above reduces the amount of
information present in the digital video file.

\iffalse
Each frame of a video can show several projection screens, each with a
different presentation slide. Since the lens of a video camera capturing the
scene is unlikely to be perpendicular to any screen, there is likely to be
perspective distortion that we need to deal with. Beside perspective, uneven
illumination will
